# 🕹️ Play Man
An awesome retro console emulator written in c++.  
Made with ❤️ by [@rvan-mee](https://github.com/rvan-mee) and [@K1ngmar](https://github.com/K1ngmar)

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Cmake version >= 3.22.1
- A compiler with >= c++17 support

## 🔨 How to install
```bash
# clone the respository
$ git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:rvan-mee/play-man.git

# create build folder
$ mkdir build
$ cd build

# generate build files
$ cmake ..

# build the project
$ make install

# play some awesome emulated games
$ cd ../bin
$ ./play-man
```

## 🛠️ Tools used

### 👾 Graphics, input and audio library
For our graphics, input and audio we use [SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)](https://www.libsdl.org/). We chose this library because it grants us low level access to the graphicshardware, audio and input devices. It also supports OpenGl and Direct3D.

### ⛏️ Building
We chose [CMake](https://cmake.org/) for our C++ project due to its flexibility, portability, and ability to manage complex build systems effectively.

### 🧑‍🔬 Unit testing
For our unit tets we chose [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) as it is quick and easy to get started with no external dependencies, has cmake integration and is well established.

### 📋 Settings and serialization
For our settings and serialization we used [nlohmann's json library](https://github.com/nlohmann/json). This is very useful as it supplies an easy interface for serializing classes into json [see](https://json.nlohmann.me/features/arbitrary_types/). On top of that it integrates nicely with our enum macro for storing enum values in the json [see](https://json.nlohmann.me/features/enum_conversion/).
